## Introduction
This repository contains projects of Data Mining Course. There are four projects.<br>
> 1.  first project, is about ```preprocessing``` that we use ```pandas``` and ```Scikit-learn``` for this purpose. The dataset we use is ```iris-dataset```.<br><br>
> 2.  second project, is about creating a ```Neural Network``` and we train the model for two datasets: ```make_circles``` and ```fashion_mnist```.<br><br>
> 3.  third project, is about ```Association Rules``` and also ```Clustering```, There are two different projects.<br><br>
> 4.  and final project, we train a model with a dataset which has more than 70k records and we should decide whether a person has a special disease or not, for this project we use ```XGBoost``` that is a ```decision tree```.

## ðŸ’» First Project
This project is about ```preprocessing``` that we use ```pandas``` and ```Scikit-learn``` for this purpose. The dataset we use is ```iris-dataset``` which can be downloaded by this [link](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Data-Mining/blob/master/Project%201/iris.data). i do the following steps for preprocessing ```iris-dataset```.<br>
> 1.  handle ```missing values``` and find NaN values and fill them with proper values or remove them.
> 2.  convert categorical features to numerical features by ```Label Encoding``` and ```One Hot Encoding```.
> 3.  nomalize data frame by the help of ```Standard Scalar```.
> 4.  dimension reduction with ```PCA```.
> 5.  ```visualization```.<br>

The visualization of the final result is:<br>

## ðŸ’» Second Project
This project is about creating a ```Neural Network``` and we train the model for two datasets: ```make_circles``` and ```fashion_mnist```.<br><br>
for first dataset (```make_circles```) i follow these steps:
> 1.  make 1000 circles.
> 2.  split train and test dataset.
> 3.  create a ```Neural Network``` with two hidden layers.
> 4.  train model.
> 5.  plot loss and accuracy.<br>

for acctivation functions i used ```relu``` for hidden layers and ```sigmoid``` for the output layer and ```binary_crossentropy``` for loss function.<br>
You can access to code of this section by this [link](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Data-Mining/blob/master/Project%202/DM_HW2_1.ipynb).<br><br>

for second dataset (```fashion_mnist```) i follow these steps:
> 1.  load dataset.
> 2.  split train and test dataset.
> 3.  create a ```Convolutional Neural Network``` with two hidden layers.
> 4.  train model.
> 5.  plot loss and accuracy.
> 6.  ```print confusion_matrix``` and ```classification_report```.<br>

for acctivation functions i used ```relu``` for hidden layers and ```softmax``` for the output layer and ```categorical_crossentropy``` for loss function and ```adam``` for optimizer.<br>

## ðŸ’» Third Project
This project is about ```Association Rules``` and also ```Clustering```, There are two different projects.<br>

for ```clustring``` project i did these tasks:
> 1.  working with ```KMeans``` library from sklearn.cluster and plotting result.
> 2.  determining efficient number of clusters with two methods: ```elbow``` and ```PCA```.
> 3.  working with complex datasets and clustering them.
> 4.  working with ```load_digits``` dataset and cluster this dataset. 
> 5.  dimenshion reduction of a picture.
> 6.  do ```DBSCAN``` algorithm for two datasets.
> 7.  determining efficient value for ```MinPts``` and ```epsilon```.
> 8.  plotting results and comparison results.<br>

You can access to code of this section by this [link](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Data-Mining/blob/master/Project%203/Clustering.ipynb).<br><br>

for ```Association Rules``` project i did these tasks:
> 1.  working with ```Apriori``` algorithm.
> 2.  load this [dataset](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Data-Mining/blob/master/Project%203/Hypermarket_dataset.csv) and preprocess it and create dataframe.
> 3.  find frequent_itemsets and print them.
> 4.  extract association_rules.<br>
