## Introduction
This repository contains projects of Data Mining Course. There are four projects.<br>
> 1.  first project, is about ```preprocessing``` that we use ```pandas``` and ```Scikit-learn``` for this purpose. The dataset we use is ```iris-dataset```.<br><br>
> 2.  second project, is about creating a ```Neural Network``` and we train the model for two datasets: ```make_circles``` and ```fashion_mnist```.<br><br>
> 3.  third project, is about ```Association Rules``` and also ```Clustering```, There are two different projects.<br><br>
> 4.  and final project, we train a model with a dataset which has more than 70k records and we should decide whether a person has a special disease or not, for this project we use ```XGBoost``` that is a ```decision tree```.

## ðŸ’» First_Project
This project is about ```preprocessing``` that we use ```pandas``` and ```Scikit-learn``` for this purpose. The dataset we use is ```iris-dataset``` which can be downloaded by this [link](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Data-Mining/blob/master/Project%201/iris.data).
